# Diabetes-disease-prediction-using-machine-learnig
day2 of creating machine learning projects no one asked me to.i used machine learning svm  model to create a diabetes disease prediction system.in this project i employed some important concepts like datapreprocessing methods like data standardization using standard scaler.i have used support vector machine ,a machine learning model to make prediction and used Pima diabetes dataset from kaggle.com to train my model.
i have included comments in my code for easy understanding of the concepts i have implemented.
